    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p1>Begin by soaking the sliced potato strips in a bowl of water for about 30 minutes to draw out the starch â€” this
        ensures
        the most deliciously crispy results. Pat potatoes dry, then add them to a pot of preheated oil and fry for five
        minutes.

        Allow the potatoes to cool before frying them a second time. Let cook until golden brown, then blot with a paper
        towel
        and salt before serving. Double-frying guarantees a wonderful crunch that will keep you coming back for more.

        <li>1 large russet potato, cut into evenly sized strips
        </li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak potato strips in a large bowl of water for about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pat with paper towels until thoroughly dry.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Gently add potatoes to the hot
